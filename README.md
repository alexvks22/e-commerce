# e-commerce
A small e-commerce shop with specific technology products implemented in Java using Servlets, JSP and JPA Annotations.
This repository has been created in order to present concepts of Java such as Inheritance, Encapsulation, Commenting practices and reusability of components and use of Servlets combined with JSP.

A simple interface has been created using Bootstrap 4 and HTML5.

The idea behind this e-commerce is that we have an eshop with products such as:
1) PC Tower
2) PC Screen
3) Personal Computer
4) Workstation

As far as concerned PC Tower, user must select how much memory he/she wants (in GB) and cpu (in GHz). For PC Screen the only thing user has to select is inches. A Personal Computer consists of a PC Tower, a PC Screen and an hd (Hard Disk) of a certain capacity (in GB). Finally, a workstation consists of a Personal Computer and the preferable Operating System (os) - e.g. Linux or Windows.

Caution! Hard Disk and Operating System cannot sold seperatelly.

User can buy a product at a time.
When user selects his/her preferable product to buy, then an Order is created with the name of the product to be bought, date of order and a description of the product.

This project was implemented for interview purposes for the improvIT Company at 03/2020.
